# Part 2: Creating Your Project Directory

Now that your system is prepared, you can create a dedicated workspace for your MkDocs project. 

You will perform all of the following steps in your **terminal**.

---

## 1. Create Your Project Directory

First, create a new directory for your project. 

```bash
mkdir my_docs
```
>You can substitute `my_docs` with any name of your choice.

## 2. Navigate into the Directory

Next, move into the new directory you just created. 

```bash
cd my_docs
```


## 3. Open the Workspace in VS Code

Finally, open your new project directory in VS Code.

```bash
code .
```

After running this command, _VS Code_ will open with your new project folder, where you'll set up your environment and install MkDocs in the next part.
